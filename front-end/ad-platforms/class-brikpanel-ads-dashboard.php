/**
 * BrikPanel — Ad Platforms dashboard injector.
 *
 * Wires the Ad Platforms module into the BrikPanel dashboard via the two
 * hooks added to Brikpanel_Dashboard:
 *
 *   - `brikpanel_dashboard_after_kpis` (action)  → render extra KPI cards.
 *   - `brikpanel_dashboard_data`       (filter)  → attach ad_spend payload.
 *
 * Renders three new cards next to the existing KPIs:
 *
 *   - Ad Spend  — sum across all connected platforms in the active range.
 *   - ROAS      — store revenue ÷ ad spend (single number, or "—" if no
 *                 ad spend in the range).
 *   - Net Profit — revenue − COGS − ad spend − manual expenses.
 *
 * The class is also responsible for two practical details:
 *
 *   - Multi-currency. Ad accounts often report in a different currency than
 *     the store. We never blindly sum mixed currencies — when more than one
 *     currency is present we group spend per currency and the front-end
 *     shows them as "₺X + $Y" so the merchant knows both halves.
 *
 *   - Currency-aware ROAS / Net Profit. When the ad currency differs from
 *     the store currency, those derived figures can't be computed without
 *     a conversion rate. We omit them (UI shows "—") rather than print a
 *     bogus number the user will treat as gospel.
 *
